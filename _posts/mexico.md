Mexico is a land of Mexicans, and you can't take that away from them.  They do let the odd Gringo in from time to time and so it was I landed in Mexico City and was welcomed with loving passport control where they didn't question why I had no return or onward flights out of the country.  Which was a good thing because I didn't and continued to didn't throughout the travels.  Thoughts on that maybe another time.

On another random side note, I use the term 'Latin America' cos it's a nice catch all term for everything south of USA.  I read online someone moaning that the term is bad and there is no such thing so apologies to anyone offended by the term but what the hell else does one say?  Answers on a postcard please
